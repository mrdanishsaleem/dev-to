# My Journey from Software Quality Assurance to Software Engineering

Software Quality Assurance (SQA) was my first foray into the world of software engineering. It was a great way to learn the fundamentals of software development, while also gaining valuable insight into the software development process.

Although I enjoyed my time as an SQA engineer, I was always looking for new challenges and opportunities. That's when I decided to take the plunge and transition from SQA to software engineering.

The transition was difficult at times, but I was determined to succeed. I started out by taking online courses in various programming languages and frameworks. I also read books and articles on the latest software development topics.

I also took advantage of any opportunities I had to work on software engineering projects. This gave me a chance to put my newly acquired knowledge into practice and gain valuable practical experience.

Along the way, I received invaluable help from mentors, colleagues, and friends. With their guidance, I was able to refine my skills, gain experience, and become a better software engineer.

Today, I'm very proud of the progress I've made in my transition from SQA to software engineering. I'm excited to continue learning, growing, and pushing myself to become a better software engineer.
