| 1. Bootstrap is a component-based framework. It is based on object-oriented CSS.                                                                                                                                   | 1. Tailwind is known as Utility-First CSS is high customization.                                                                 |
| 2. Bootstrap comes with a set of pre-made components that are used to design a typical website quickly.                                                                                                            | 2. You can style each component of your website as Tailwind UI demands from it.                                                  |
| 3. Bootstrap CSS is an easy-to-learn framework that maintains consistency for different browsers and devices. If you know CSS, then it is pretty easy to learn customization in Bootstrap for website development. | 3. This framework has no ready-made components for designing. You can build your own custom components with the utility classes. |

## 2. Performance: Bootstrap vs Tailwind CSS

| **Bootstrap**                                                                                                                                  | **Tailwind CSS**                                                                                               |

| 1. Bootstrap requires four main files to be incorporated in the project for development which require heavy space to be occupied about 300 kb. | 1. In Tailwind CSS, we need style sheets to get our task done. This CSS file occupies about 30kb of the space. |
| 2. In Bootstrap, we have a lot of overhead code, and this causes the build time to be around 160 seconds.                                      | 2. As Tailwind has built-in utility libraries, this shortens the build time up to 8 to 10 seconds.             |

## 3. Community: Bootstrap vs Tailwind CSS

Bootstrap has a larger community compared to tailwind CSS. Thatâ€™s why there is still a lot of room for Tailwind to have a strong community of developers and tools.

## 4. Which one to Pick and Why?

So, we can conclude that if you are working as a new backend developer, you should opt for Bootstrap first. Whereas if you are working as front-end developer, then Tailwind CSS is the better option for the custom designs.

But in the end, it is your choice either you want to go with Bootstrap for responsive design, or you want high customization in style your web with advantages of Tailwind CSS. It depends on project requirements and personal preferences.
