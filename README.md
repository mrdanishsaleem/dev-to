# WCAG Guidelines and How to Test Your Website for Accessibility

Web accessibility is the practice of making web content more accessible to people with disabilities. It also benefits other users who may have different preferences, needs, or limitations. Web accessibility is not only a moral and social responsibility, but also a legal requirement in many countries and regions.

One of the most widely used and recognized standards for web accessibility is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). WCAG provides a set of principles, guidelines, and success criteria for making web content more accessible to people with various disabilities, such as visual, auditory, physical, cognitive, and neurological impairments.

WCAG has three versions: WCAG 2.0, published in 2008; WCAG 2.1, published in 2018; and WCAG 2.2 Draft, scheduled to be finalized in April 2023. Each version builds on the previous one, adding new success criteria to address emerging issues and technologies. WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 are backwards compatible with WCAG 2.0, meaning that content that conforms to the latest version also conforms to the earlier versions.

WCAG is organized around four principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. These principles state that web content must be:

- Perceivable: available to the senses (vision, hearing, touch) through assistive technologies (such as screen readers, hearing aids, etc.)
- Operable: usable with various input devices (such as keyboard, mouse, voice control, etc.)
- Understandable: clear and consistent in language, structure, and functionality
- Robust: compatible with current and future technologies and user agents (such as browsers, media players, etc.)

Each principle has a number of guidelines that provide specific goals for web accessibility. Each guideline has a number of testable success criteria that define how to meet the guideline. The success criteria are categorized into three levels of conformance: A (lowest), AA (medium), and AAA (highest). Depending on the context and purpose of the web content, different levels of conformance may be required or recommended.

To test your website for accessibility according to WCAG standards, you can use a combination of methods and tools, such as:

- Manual testing: checking your website manually using different browsers, devices, and assistive technologies; following checklists and best practices; involving users with disabilities in testing and feedback
- Automated testing: using software tools that scan your website for common accessibility issues and generate reports; examples of such tools include WAVE, axe, Lighthouse, etc.
- Expert evaluation: hiring or consulting accessibility professionals who can conduct a comprehensive audit of your website and provide recommendations for improvement

Testing your website for accessibility is not a one-time task, but an ongoing process that requires regular monitoring and maintenance. By following WCAG guidelines and testing your website for accessibility, you can ensure that your web content is more inclusive, usable, and compliant.
