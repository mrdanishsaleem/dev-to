# How to use CSS variables to create dynamic themes

CSS variables, also known as custom properties, are a powerful feature that allows you to define and reuse values in your stylesheets. You can use them to create dynamic themes that can be changed with a single line of code.

To use CSS variables, you need to declare them using the `--` syntax and assign them a value. For example:

```CSS
:root {
    --primary-color: #f0f;
    --secondary-color: #0ff;
    --background-color: #fff;
    }
```

This creates three variables that can be used anywhere in your stylesheet. To use them, you need to reference them using the `var()` function. For example:

```HTML
h1 {
    color: var(--primary-color);
    }

p {
    color: var(--secondary-color);
    }

body {
    background-color: var(--background-color);
    }
```

This will apply the colors defined by the variables to the elements. To change the theme, you just need to change the values of the variables. For example:

```CSS
:root {
    --primary-color: #f00;
    --secondary-color: #0f0;
    --background-color: #000;
    }
```

This will change the colors of the elements without changing any other code. You can also use CSS variables to create custom properties that can be used for other purposes, such as animations, calculations, or media queries.

CSS variables are a great way to create dynamic and flexible themes for your web projects. Try them out and see what you can create!
